        <strong>Hobbies</strong>
        <p>
          A hobby is usually defined as any enjoyable leisure activity that we
          engage in voluntarily and consistently when we are free from the
          demands of work or other responsibilities. A hobby may be inspired by
          an interest, but it typically requires more commitment and involves
          taking action, like learning a new skill, or collecting, building or
          creating something. Hobbies are essentially the active pursuit of a
          personal interest. <br />

        <strong>Movies</strong>
        <p>
          A film, also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, picture
          or photoplay is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and
          otherwise communicates ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty,
          or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are
          generally accompanied by sound and, more rarely, other sensory
          stimulations.[1] The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often
          used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form
          that is the result of it.Movies create an imaginary world that looks,
          in most cases, like in the real world.
