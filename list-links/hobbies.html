          its historical period or place of origin.

          Origami from ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper" (kami
          changes to gami due to rendaku)) is the art of paper folding, which is
          often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word
          "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices,
          regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat
          square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and
          sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally
          discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami
          folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs which
          use cuts. <br /><a
