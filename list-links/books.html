      <li><strong>The Immortals of Meluha</strong><br>
    <div><img src="./src/meluha.jpeg" alt="Coverpage of The Immortals of Meluha" width="200"></div>
    <p>The Immortals of Meluha describes the period of 1900 BC. Indians today wrongly refer to this period as the Indus Valley Civilization. It was known as the land of Meluha by the locals at that time. Lord Ram, one of history's greatest kings, built a nearly ideal empire many centuries previously. The venerated Saraswati, this formerly proud empire's main river, is steadily disappearing, posing grave dangers to its Suryavanshi rulers. They also experience devastating terrorist attacks from the Chandravanshi region in the east. Even worse, it appears that the Chandravanshis have joined forces with the Nagas, an outcast species of distorted humans with incredible fighting prowess.

          depicts the autobiography of Karna.More so often, the study of Karnas

          that Vyasa has created for him. <br />
